# Aggie-Grocer

Aggie Grocer is a web application that suggests recipes based on the user's
current inventory. Unlike most applications that do this service, Aggie
Grocer uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to scan receipts and add
items to the current inventory, thus removing the tedious task of manually
updating inventory.
